 * Ticket #84 (Klaster E): moved from `packages/application/src/telemetry/`.
 * These records intentionally store only numeric usage, timing, and status
 * metadata — never raw prompts, completions, tool output, API keys, or
 * authorization headers. `traceId` is the correlation key that joins a
 * turn summary to the provider requests it produced.
 *
 * Naming mirrors the runtime's canonical AgentTokenUsage shape
 * (`inputTokens`/`cachedInputTokens`/…) rather than OpenAI's
 * `prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`. Fresh (uncached) input is derived as
 * `inputTokens - cachedInputTokens`; cache hit rate as
 * `cachedInputTokens / inputTokens`.
