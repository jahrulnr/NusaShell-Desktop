  - Type: toggle
  - Action: Enables or disables inline HTML/SVG/Mermaid rendering and the canvas sidebar. When off, canvas fences stay as source code blocks.

## Agent runtime

Configures how the agent picks and retries models: provider strategy, attempt budget, vision mode, user prompt, and streaming.

- **Agent runtime form** (`#ai-runtime-form`):
  - Section: Agent runtime
  - Type: form
  - Action: Contains the provider strategy, attempt budget, vision, and stream settings. Submit saves the runtime.

  - Section: Agent runtime
  - Type: number input
  - Action: Maximum number of agent tool-call attempts per turn (1–32).

- **Vision** (`#settings-ai-vision`):
  - Section: Agent runtime
  - Type: select

## Global model

Sets the model the shell runs by default for scheduled job/pipeline agent turns, the context compaction summarizer, and new rooms that have not picked their own model. Uses the same single source of truth as the composer picker.
