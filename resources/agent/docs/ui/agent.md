# Agent

The agent conversation workspace. Chat with the NusaShell agent, attach files, pick models, and manage conversation threads.

**How to open:** Click the Agent item in the left sidebar.

## Conversation list

A fixed workbench rail listing local conversation threads. Click a thread to open it; use the × button to delete. At narrow widths the rail becomes a focusable Rooms drawer opened from the compact Agent toolbar, so room switching remains available without consuming chat width.

## Conversation thread

The full-height message runway separates compact user cards from editorial assistant responses. User attachments render as image previews or file cards. Provider reasoning is persisted and appears before the answer in a collapsed Thinking disclosure with sanitized Markdown; models that return no reasoning show no placeholder. Tool calls render as terminal cards that stay collapsed by default even while a tool is actively streaming, so live output never takes over the transcript; expand one deliberately to inspect args/output. Interactive ask_question calls render as Ask Question cards with selectable options and an optional free-text answer; after the user replies, the sealed card shows the chosen answer. Message footers expose timestamps, the selected route/model, trace metadata, copy, and retry where applicable. If the provider reports a different upstream model, the footer keeps the user's selection visible and exposes the resolved identity in a tooltip. Only this area scrolls, and the pinned reader follows content across reasoning, tool, and text transitions even when the window is unfocused.

- **Recover turn** (`.agent-retry-btn`):
  - Section: Conversation thread
  - Type: button
  - Action: Appears on a failed or interrupted assistant turn. Resume is shown only when a durable provider transcript with settled tool calls exists; Continue extends saved partial text, while Retry re-runs a retry-only failure.

## Room diagnostics

A compact floating Room info control stays at the top-right of the conversation. Activating it opens a small diagnostics popover with the selected conversation title, total persisted tool calls (including nested subagent calls), total recorded compactions, and the full conversation ID. The ID is truncated visually and can be copied; the popover closes with its close button, Escape, or an outside click. Legacy rooms with a checkpoint but no historical count display one compaction as a safe lower-bound fallback.

## Subagent activity

When the parent agent delegates work through the subagent tool, an in-chat Subagent run card appears in the message thread. While the subagent run is active, the card shows a compact mini activity stream (roughly ten monospace rows) that mirrors the full Subagent side pane: live reasoning, text snippets, tool calls with success/failure marks, and plan progress. Both streams auto-scroll to the bottom while the user is pinned to the tail; scrolling up pauses stickiness until the user returns to the bottom. Clicking the card head opens the full Subagent side pane, which preserves the complete live log with markdown rendering, expandable tool terminals, plan steps, and permission/ask cards. Clicks inside the mini stream do not toggle the drawer. When the run ends, its lifecycle event seals the exact card with the real run identity and summary; later parent tool completion cannot replace that terminal content. Complete stream steps and the summary persist with the conversation for review after the turn or after reopening the room. If no steps were captured, the side pane shows the summary instead of an empty waiting state.

- **Subagent side pane** (`#agent-subpane`):
  - Section: Agent
  - Type: drawer
  - Action: Drawer below the NusaShell titlebar that renders the complete live or persisted subagent stream with markdown, tool terminals, plans, and permission/ask cards; terminal runs fall back to their saved summary when no stream steps exist.

It follows new deltas only while the reader is at the bottom; scrolling up pauses auto-follow until the reader returns to the tail. A terminal run without captured steps renders its saved summary.

- **Subagent run card** (`.agent-subagent-card`):
  - Section: Agent
  - Type: card

## Subagent attention

Permission and ask requests from a subagent are promoted into a persistent attention stack above the composer in the main room. This keeps the required action visible even when the user is not watching the side pane. Pending cards remain actionable; once a decision is accepted, its card is removed from the active stack so resolved work does not compete with new actions.

- **Subagent attention stack** (`#agent-attention-stack`):
  - Section: Subagent attention

  - Action: Shows how many subagent requests still need a user decision.

- **Subagent request list** (`#agent-attention-list`):
  - Section: Subagent attention
  - Type: list
  - Action: Contains actionable permission or ask cards; sealed decisions remain compact and the list collapses when no request is pending.

## Composer

A compact command dock at the bottom of the thread. Its message input starts at one row, grows with wrapped or explicit lines, and caps at ten rows before scrolling internally. Attachment, model, and workspace context stay grouped separately from context usage and turn actions; long labels truncate, and actions wrap below only at very narrow widths. During an active turn, submitting a non-empty draft creates one visible steer card without interrupting current reasoning or tool work. The steer can be cancelled while it waits, then enters the same active trace after provider reasoning (before newly proposed tools start) or after tools that were already live settle. After it is applied, the card remains as status until the turn settles. Changing the workspace during an active agent turn updates tool routing immediately and supplies a fresh synthetic runtime snapshot before the next provider round.

- **Composer form** (`#agent-form`):
  - Section: Composer
  - Type: form
  - Action: Wraps the message textarea, attachments, and send controls. Submit triggers the agent turn.

- **Message input** (`#agent-input`):
  - Section: Composer
  - Type: textarea

  - Shortcut: Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter submits the turn.

- **Attachment chips** (`#agent-attachments`):
  - Section: Composer
  - Type: list
  - Action: Shows files attached to the current turn. Each chip can be removed.

- **File attachment input** (`#agent-file-input`):
  - Section: Composer
  - Type: file input
  - Action: Hidden file picker triggered by the attach button. It inspects file bytes, accepting supported images and PDFs plus valid UTF-8 text such as source code, markup, and configuration; filenames and claimed MIME types are not trusted. Files can also be dropped onto the window while the Agent view is active, which enters the same pipeline (see shell-drop-overlay).

- **Attach files** (`#agent-attach-btn`):
  - Section: Composer
  - Type: icon button
  - Action: Opens the file picker to attach images, PDFs, or UTF-8 text files to the current turn. Up to 4 files, each under 4 MiB. Text attachments are included as text context for every chat model. Unless image input is disabled in Agent runtime settings, images are sent optimistically; a provider 4xx response retries the same turn once without image parts.

- **Pending steer** (`#agent-steer-queue`):
  - Section: Composer
  - Type: status region
  - Action: Shows the one user steer waiting to enter the current agent trace at a safe provider/tool boundary. It changes to applied status after the runner consumes it.

  - Type: submit button
  - Action: Submits the composer form and starts an agent turn. If the room already owns a turn, it creates a visible cancellable steer that enters the same trace at the next safe provider/tool boundary. Send is disabled while one steer is pending. Shortcut is shown as a tooltip (Ctrl+Enter / ⌘↩).
  - Shortcut: Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter submits the turn.

## Task strip

A collapsible checklist above the composer that mirrors the agent-owned todo list. The agent writes it via the `todo` meta-tool; the user can delete individual items (which removes them from the runtime port so they do not reappear in the next prompt injection) and collapse the strip. It hides automatically when the list is empty.

  - Section: Task strip
  - Type: list
  - Action: Renders each task with a status glyph and a delete button. Clicking the delete button removes the item via agent.todos_delete.

## Background jobs strip

A compact, collapsed-by-default strip above the composer (below the task strip) shows active async tool jobs started via `async_run`. Its collapsible header includes the active-job count; each card keeps the tool name, status badge, and Stop action on one row, with live tail or error output shown below only when present. The strip rehydrates from `agent.tool_job_list` on conversation open and hides as soon as no jobs are running.

- **Background jobs strip** (`.agent-tool-job-strip`):
  - Section: Background jobs strip
  - Type: container
  - Action: Shows the compact background-job section and active-job count. Hides when no jobs are running.

- **Collapse background jobs** (`.agent-tool-job-strip-toggle`):
  - Section: Background jobs strip

## Agent Canvas

A shell-owned canvas drawer over the agent workbench. Completed assistant messages auto-render html, svg, and mermaid fences inline (mermaid is lazy-loaded, strict mode; html uses a sandboxed iframe via renderArtifact, sandbox=allow-scripts, no allow-same-origin, CSP with an empty external allowlist in v1); the raw fence is hidden after a successful render. Show source hides the inline preview and reveals a scrollable source block capped at about 10 rows; Hide source restores the preview. Sidebar opens the overlay drawer. html fences also show a compact artifact card with a type badge, title, size hint, Sidebar, and Show source. The drawer slides in from the right with a dimmed overlay (plugin-drawer style); it shows one active artifact at a time with a type badge, Refresh, Download source, and Close (overlay click or Escape also closes). Artifacts persist per conversation and restore on reopen; a Settings toggle disables the canvas entirely.
