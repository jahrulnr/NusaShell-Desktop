# Learning

Reviews saved learning data in two focused views: a table for timeline and node details, and a full-width Connections graph.

**How to open:** Click the Learning item in the left sidebar.

## View tabs

Switches between the Table view for browsing and editing nodes and the Connections view for exploring relationships across the full available width.

- **Table view** (`#learning-tab-table`):
  - Section: View tabs
  - Type: tab
  - Action: Shows the learning timeline and selected node detail.

- **Connections view** (`#learning-tab-connections`):
  - Section: View tabs
  - Type: tab
  - Action: Shows the full-width learning connections graph.

## Stats

Summary cards showing the total number of learned skills, memory entries, agent-created nodes, and nodes used in turns.

- **Learned skills count** (`#learning-stat-skills`):
  - Section: Stats
  - Type: stat card
  - Action: Shows the total number of learned skill nodes in the graph.

- **Memory entries count** (`#learning-stat-memory`):
  - Section: Stats
  - Type: stat card
  - Action: Shows the total number of memory entry nodes in the graph.

- **Agent-created count** (`#learning-stat-agent`):
  - Section: Stats
  - Type: stat card
  - Action: Shows the number of nodes created by the agent (as opposed to user-created).

- **Used in turns count** (`#learning-stat-used`):
  - Section: Stats
  - Type: stat card
  - Action: Shows the number of nodes that have been used in at least one agent turn.

## Timeline

The Table view contains a chronological list of learning nodes grouped by day. Each row shows a colored dot indicating kind (skill or memory) and state (active, stale, archived), the node label, category, use count, and a pin indicator. Click a row to inspect it in the detail pane.

- **Learning timeline** (`#learning-timeline-list`):
  - Section: Timeline
  - Type: listbox
  - Action: Chronological list of learning nodes grouped by day. Click a row to inspect it in the detail pane.

- **Timeline node count** (`#learning-timeline-count`):
  - Section: Timeline
  - Type: status text
  - Action: Shows the total number of nodes in the timeline.

- **Learning empty state** (`#learning-empty`):
  - Section: Timeline
  - Type: status
  - Action: Shown when the agent has not created any skills or memory entries yet.

## Constellation

The Connections view gives the graph the full available panel width and height, with the time scrubber anchored as its footer. It uses a compact force layout for related nodes and packs isolated nodes nearby, with edges between related skills. Node size reflects connection degree and labels become selective on larger graphs as the user zooms. Node color reflects kind and state. Click a dot to select the node and highlight its neighborhood. The time scrubber fades nodes that fall after the selected percentage of the timeline.

- **Constellation graph** (`#learning-constellation-canvas`):
  - Section: Constellation
  - Type: interactive graph
  - Action: Visualizes learning nodes with Sigma.js and Graphology using a force-directed layout, curved edges, semantic zoom, and neighborhood selection.

- **Constellation metadata** (`#learning-constellation-meta`):
  - Section: Constellation
  - Type: status text
  - Action: Shows the number of edges in the constellation graph.

- **Zoom in connections** (`#learning-zoom-in`):
  - Section: Constellation
  - Type: button
  - Action: Increases the connection graph scale.

- **Zoom out connections** (`#learning-zoom-out`):
  - Section: Constellation
  - Type: button
  - Action: Decreases the connection graph scale.

- **Reset connection zoom** (`#learning-zoom-reset`):
  - Section: Constellation
  - Type: button
  - Action: Returns the connection graph to 100% scale.

- **Connection zoom value** (`#learning-zoom-value`):
  - Section: Constellation
  - Type: status text
  - Action: Shows the current connection graph scale.

- **Time scrubber** (`#learning-scrubber`):
  - Section: Constellation
  - Type: range slider
  - Action: Fades nodes that fall after the selected percentage of the timeline, revealing how the journey grew over time.

- **Scrubber value** (`#learning-scrubber-value`):
  - Section: Constellation
  - Type: status text
  - Action: Shows the current scrubber percentage.

## Detail

Shows the selected node's label and content. Memory nodes can be edited and saved; skill nodes are read-only and can be archived. Delete archives skills or removes memory entries after confirmation.

- **Node detail metadata** (`#learning-detail-meta`):
  - Section: Detail
  - Type: status text
  - Action: Shows the label of the currently selected node.

- **Detail empty state** (`#learning-detail-empty`):
  - Section: Detail
  - Type: status
  - Action: Prompt to select a node from the timeline or constellation.

- **Node content editor** (`#learning-detail-editor`):
  - Section: Detail
  - Type: textarea
  - Action: Shows the content of the selected node. Memory nodes can be edited; skill nodes are read-only.

- **Save node** (`#learning-save-btn`):
  - Section: Detail
  - Type: button
  - Action: Saves edits to the selected memory node's content.

- **Delete / Archive node** (`#learning-delete-btn`):
  - Section: Detail
  - Type: button
  - Action: Archives the selected skill node or removes the selected memory entry after confirmation.

- **Refresh graph** (`#learning-refresh-btn`):
  - Section: Detail
  - Type: button
  - Action: Reloads the entire learning graph from the backend.
