# Local agent skills

NusaShell maintains a local, managed skills library for portable instruction
packages. This is deliberately smaller than the full platform described in
`agent-skills-platform-technical-spec.md`.

## Current boundary

- An install accepts a ZIP-compatible `.skill` or `.zip` archive containing one
  package-root `SKILL.md`.
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter must contain a lowercase slug `name` and a
  `description`. The name becomes the stable installed ID. Optional
  `requirements.mcp` lists concrete plugin ids or role tokens such as
  `role:files`; `compatibility` and string `metadata` are preserved.
- Electron stores copied packages below `userData/skills`. Built-in packages are
  seeded from `resources/agent/skills/` with `builtin` provenance; editing and
  deletion never mutate the source package.
- The application layer owns `SkillRegistryPort`; filesystem and archive work
  stays in the infrastructure adapter.
- Archive extraction rejects absolute/traversal paths and symbolic links, and
  caps entry count, per-file size, and expanded package size. Registry reads and
  writes resolve only below the selected managed skill.

## Agent tools

The shell exposes read-only meta-tools and a gated mutation meta-tool on every
agent turn:

- `skill_list` returns bounded installed-skill summaries.
- `skill_search` searches names and descriptions.
- `skill_read` reads `SKILL.md` or another bounded text file using a skill ID
  and relative path.
- `skill_manage` lets the agent create, edit, write support files in, or delete
  **agent-owned** skills only. User-installed skills are protected and cannot be
  mutated by the model.

## Skills catalog injection (Layer 1)

Pure "tools only + hope the model lists skills" underperforms: the model rarely
calls `skill_list` spontaneously, so seeded domain skills stay invisible. To
fix this, a budgeted **skills catalog** (name + description for every installed
skill) is included in the hidden runtime hydration transcript. The latest
complete transcript is replayed across provider turns and refreshed at runtime
boundaries. It stays outside the cache-stable system prefix and visible
conversation history.

- **Source:** `SkillRegistryPort.list()` summaries — the same data that powers
  `skill_list`. Full `SKILL.md` bodies are never injected.
- **Builder:** `buildSkillsCatalogPrompt(summaries, budget)` orders skills with
  priority builtins (`mcp-creator`, `skill-creator`) first, then alphabetical.
  Each description is clamped to ~400 chars; the total block is clamped to
  ~3000 chars. When truncated, a tail note directs the model to `skill_list` /
  `skill_search` for the rest.
- **Injection:** `RunAgentTurnHandler.injectSystemPrompts` calls the builder and
  passes the result to `injectPrompts` as the `skillsCatalogPrompt` parameter.
  The catalog is skipped when there are no skills (no block injected), mirroring
  the `formatMemoryPrompt` empty → undefined contract.
- **Scope:** Interactive turns only. Jobs and background review turns do not
  inject the catalog (jobs denylist skill tools; review turns already have a
  restricted gateway). Subagent turns today have no skill tools → no catalog.
- **Failure mode:** If the registry `list()` call throws, the catalog is
  skipped and a warning is logged — the turn still runs.

The body stays progressive (Layer 2): the model reads a full `SKILL.md` via
`skill_read` only when the task matches a catalog entry. See the Skills workflow
section in `resources/agent/prompts/mcp-tools.md` for the protocol text.

### Provenance

A `SkillProvenancePort` sidecar (`.provenance.json` in the skills root) tracks
whether each skill was created by the agent or installed by the user.

- `installFromArchive` marks the skill as `user` origin.
- Built-in seed packages are marked `builtin` and are protected from
  `skill_manage` mutation/deletion.
- `skill_manage` `create` marks the skill as `agent` origin.
- `skill_manage` `edit`, `write_file`, and `delete` check provenance before
  mutating; non-agent skills return a `skill_protected` error.

### SKILL.md validation

- The `description` frontmatter field must be **1024 characters or fewer** and
  should explain what the skill does and when to use it with trigger terms.
- The `name` frontmatter field must match the skill ID slug.
- Support file creation via `write_file` is limited to `references/`,
  `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` subdirectories.

### Skill VERSION file

A skill package may carry a `VERSION` file (bare integer, e.g. `2`) at its
package root alongside `SKILL.md`. The integer is the skill's own content
revision number, independent of the NusaShell release version in the repo
root `VERSION`. Bumping it signals that the skill's instructions, references,
or templates changed in a way downstream consumers (catalog injection,
`skill_read` callers, release notes) should notice. A skill without a
`VERSION` file is accepted with no version gate. Built-in seeded skills
(`resources/agent/skills/<name>/VERSION`) are the canonical examples:
`mcp-creator` is at `2` after the 0.4.0 tool-naming (create vs convert)
revision; `skill-creator` is at `1`.

### Write-approval staging

When `skills.write_approval` is enabled in the desktop config, skill mutations
from `skill_manage` are staged as pending writes (`.pending/{id}.json` in the
skills root) instead of applied immediately. The desktop UI shows pending
writes with Approve and Reject buttons. Approving applies the mutation;
rejecting discards it.

Skill content is untrusted context. Installation, editing, and deletion are
also available as desktop UI operations.

`skill_exec` is intentionally absent. Adding it requires a separate decision
covering process isolation, interpreter policy, filesystem/network access,
resource limits, user approval, cancellation, and audit logging.

## Background Learning Review

After each successful agent turn, a `BackgroundReviewScheduler` ticks counters
and fire-and-forget spawns a restricted review turn when thresholds are
crossed. The review turn uses a `ReviewAgentToolGateway` that whitelists only
`memory`, `skill_list`, `skill_search`, `skill_read`, and `skill_manage` —
no MCP/plugin tools are available.

### Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master toggle |
| `memoryEveryNTurns` | `10` | Turns between memory reviews |
| `skillEveryNToolRounds` | `10` | Tool rounds between skill reviews |
| `maxToolRounds` | `6` | Max rounds for the review turn |
| `transcriptTailMessages` | `40` | Messages from the end of the transcript to send |

### Write origin and staging

When `writeOrigin` is `"background_review"`, skill mutations are staged via
`SkillApprovalStaging` instead of applied directly. The user sees pending
writes in the desktop UI and can approve or reject them.

### Event

When the review turn produces mutations, an `agent.learning_updated` event is
dispatched through the `EventDispatcher` and mapped to a WebSocket event. The
desktop launcher shows a toast notification.

### State persistence

Review counters are stored in `{memoryRoot}/.review-state.json` using
`FilesystemReviewStateStore`. The file is atomically written and survives
restarts.

### Skill curator (growth control)

Agent-owned skills are automatically curated via the `SkillCuratorService` and
`SkillCuratorScheduler`. See [skill-curator.md](./skill-curator.md) for the
full lifecycle, usage sidecar, eligibility rules, and scheduler configuration.
