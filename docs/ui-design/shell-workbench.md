# Shell workbench visual contract

NusaShell presents local AI tools as an instrument workbench: a persistent
graphite frame contains navigation, status, and the active workspace. The shell
should feel closer to dependable technical equipment than a web dashboard. Its
visual hierarchy comes from nested borders, restrained surface changes, and
compact utility typography rather than stacked cards or large shadows.

## Visual system

- **Void** `#0d0f0e`, **panel** `#131514`, and **raised panel** `#202320` form
  the graphite surface hierarchy. Borders become lighter as a control becomes
  more interactive or physically closer to the user.
- **Phosphor** `#c5f45d` is reserved for selected navigation, connection and
  running state, keyboard focus, and primary actions. Large decorative lime
  fields and gradients are outside the shell language. Selection borders use a
  translucent phosphor tint; the full-strength color is reserved for focus,
  compact indicators, and filled actions.
- Space Grotesk carries product and page titles; IBM Plex Sans carries prose;
  IBM Plex Mono carries navigation, status, search, paths, logs, and compact
  operational metadata. System fallbacks must remain usable offline.
- Corners are compact, normally 5–10 pixels. The outer frame and plugin launch
  plates may use inset rails and fastener details; ordinary cards must not copy
  that decoration.

At wide widths the labelled sidebar is deliberately stable and generous enough
for operational labels. At the 900-pixel Electron minimum it collapses to icons
so the active workspace retains useful width. At narrow browser-preview widths
the sidebar hides; no workspace action may depend exclusively on its expanded
state.

Every full-height operational workspace — Agent, Skills, Learning, Jobs,
Pipelines, and Logs — sits inside the same responsive shell gutter (12–24px).
Each remains a compact bordered workbench bay rather than touching the outer
frame; at narrow widths the gutter reduces to the small shell spacing token.
The inner message thread, file editor, log tail, and list panes retain their own
scroll ownership within that shared boundary.

Learning Connections uses the full remaining workbench height: its graph canvas
stretches between the compact header and a fixed time-range footer, so the
scrubber never hangs midway through a tall workspace.

## Home launcher

Home is an app launcher, not an analytics overview. It opens directly into a
single scoped search, then a compact labelled category rail, followed by
windowed plugin launch plates. Overview pages rely on the active sidebar item
for identity rather than repeating large page titles. Pages with actions retain
only a compact action rail, keeping controls such as Install, Refresh, and New
within reach without consuming the workspace. The category rail stays left-aligned,
scrolls horizontally when space is constrained, and marks the active filter
with the same restrained phosphor selection treatment used elsewhere in the
shell. Each plate gives mixed plugin artwork equal visual weight, exposes a
readable name, and includes a textual runtime state when applicable. Hover
raises the plate by two pixels; selection and running state remain understandable
without animation or color alone. Plugin artwork keeps its source colors:
themed glyphs must be supplied as assets rather than produced with CSS grayscale
or tint filters.

## Interaction rules

- Every actionable surface uses a native interactive element and has a visible
  phosphor focus ring.
- Motion is brief and physical (small lift or press), never ambient. Reduced
  motion disables the transitions.
- Empty and error states explain what happened and the next available action.
- Destructive actions keep the shell's red semantic color and require the
  existing confirmations. Phosphor never represents failure.
- Scroll belongs to the active data surface: message thread, file tree, editor,
  log tail, or modal body. Shell chrome remains stable.
